# python-rockpapersissors

Hey! Thanks for taking the time to look at my simple rock paper sissors script.

This script was made in a matter of minutes, though I thought it was pretty cool, and I am just starting off with python so I though I might share it.

It includes stuff like checking if there was a tie, and always generating a random choice between rock, paper, and sissors!
